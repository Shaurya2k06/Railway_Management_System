# Railway Management System

A simple C++ command-line project for managing basic railway operations. This repository contains a single C++ source file (`main.cpp`) that implements the program entry point. The README below explains how to build, run, and extend the project.

## Contents

- `main.cpp` — Program entry point and core implementation.
- `README.md` — This file.

## Overview

This project is a Railway Management System implemented in C++. It is intended as a learning or demonstration project and provides a console-based interface (or program logic) for railway-related tasks. The exact features depend on the code in `main.cpp` (for example: scheduling, reservation, cancellation, listing trains, etc.).
